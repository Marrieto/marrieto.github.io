**What is a static site generator?**
To explain what a static site generator is, you first must know what a static site is. A static site is according to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page): 
<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page">A static web page (sometimes called a flat page/stationary page) is a web page that is delivered to the user exactly as stored, in contrast to dynamic web pages which are generated by a web application.
</blockquote> A concrete example of this is how we can't put any comments under our blog posts without using Disqus.

But one doesn't always need to have a dynamic page, for example if you just want a site to show off your new project in school, or maybe a homepage for your dog, that's when static site generators comes in handy, because you can set these up very fast. For easier projects, static site generators are perfect.

**Jekyll**
Before you got your jekyll site up and running (depending on which OS you're running on) there's some setup to be done. But once you've downloaded some boilerplate, you basically have a site already, ready to customize so it fits your site.
