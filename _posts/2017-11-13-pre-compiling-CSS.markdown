***What do you think of pre-compiling your CSS?***

Compared to regular CSS, pre-compiled css alternatives offers additional useful functionality to us programmers to make our lives a little bit easier. It makes coding css a breeze compared to regular css, with functionality such as variables, nesting and more!
In our example, we used the preprocessor __SASS__. 

**Which techniques did you use**

I used mostly  the principle of variables and nesting. For example: When I wanted to change the colours on this site I changed a few variables listed that I found directly in the top of the sass file. I also used the classes pre-defined by the theme, that made customizing the layout a breeze. One thing that I saw re-occuring in the theme was nesting. 

**Pros and cons?**

Some pros and cons on pre-compiled css:

pros:

+ Better structured code
+ Easier to read and maintain 
+ Saves time once you've learned it

cons:

+ There's a learning curve
+ Takes more configuration to get it working compared to regular CSS
