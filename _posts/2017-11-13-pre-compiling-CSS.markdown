***What do you think of pre-compiling your CSS?***

Compared to regular CSS, pre-compiled css alternatives offers additional useful functionality to us programmers to make our lives a little bit easier.
In our example, we used the preprocessor *sass*. 

**Which techniques did you use**

I used mostly  the principle of variables and nesting. For example: When I wanted to change the colours on this site I changed a few variables listed that I found directly in the top of the sass file. I didn't change the theme much further myself other than the colours and some size ratios using some simple arithmetic, but I looked at the provided sass files and saw that the most re-occuring thing the developer used was nesting. 

**Pros and cons?**

Some pros and cons on pre-compiled css:

pros:
+ Better structured code
+ Easier to read and maintain 
+ Saves time once you've learned it

cons:
+ There's a learning curve
+ Takes more configuration to get it working compared to regular CSS
