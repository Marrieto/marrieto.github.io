One part of the assignement was to implement a way to put comments under our blog posts. This has to be done with a 3rd party
since every time I change something on the site, everything is re-built, meaning that there's no way to save any data. 

I solved this using a plugin called Disqus. As they say on their site: "The internet's favorite comment plug-in makes it easy for publishers to 
bring their content to life, fuel colorful discussions, efficiently moderate comments, and build engaged communities.". Disqus is easy to implement, and 
even have support for jekyll based pages. 

I  [created an account on Disqus](https://disqus.com/profile/signup/intent/), and followed the necessary steps that came up after choosing it should be a jekyll based site. 
After following the steps after, the whole process takes around five minutes if you're quick.
